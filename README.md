> **NOT SUITABLE FOR USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT**


| Question                                     | Answer                                       |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Why did you make this framework?             | Funsies                                      |
| Is it maintained?                            | Not really                                   |
| Will it ever be released for production use? | I highly doubt it                            |
| Can I contribute?                            | Sure                                         |
| Can I see it working?                        | [adameastwood.com](https://adameastwood.com) |
